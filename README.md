## Hi there 👋

##About Me
🎓 I am Soumaya Aloui, a passionate Full Stack Developer and DevOps enthusiast, currently in my final year of engineering at the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology (INSAT), specializing in DevOps. I have hands-on experience with Spring Boot, Angular, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.

👩‍💻 I enjoy working on automation projects and improving infrastructure workflows. My experience spans across building web applications, developing scalable systems, and deploying applications with tools like Terraform, Prometheus, and Grafana. I am always excited to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers to solve complex problems.

📚 In 2024, I worked on projects involving Kubernetes orchestration and CI/CD automation, and I’m always exploring new tools in the DevOps ecosystem. In my part-time role at MedSirat, I help develop a specialized social platform for entrepreneurs while managing backend deployment pipelines.

🎸 Outside of the tech world, I love exploring new skills, whether it's learning to play the guitar, drawing, or improving my cooking techniques. I enjoy pushing my limits both personally and professionally.

✈️ I’m also passionate about travel and have enjoyed exploring various parts of Tunisia.
